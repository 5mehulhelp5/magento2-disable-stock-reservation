            Remove this block "Magento\InventoryShippingAdminUi\Block\Adminhtml\Order\View\ShipButton" which takes you
            to a source selection screen if the order is deemed to need it via sales->order->ship

            The source has already been removed at the time of order shipment, so just take the admin to the old shipment
            page (which is the same functionality if manageStock was set to 0)
